# Library_management_system-in-c
The Library Management System is a C-based application designed to streamline the management of books and members in a library. It allows for efficient handling of book records, member information, and transaction logs, making it easier to maintain and organize library data.

Issue Books: Issue books to users and update the availability status of the books.
Return Books: Return books to the library and update the availability status.
Delete Books: Remove books from the library's inventory.
Save and Load Data: Data is stored in a file and can be reloaded when the program starts.


File Structure
library_management_system.c: The main source code file containing the implementation of the Library Management System.
